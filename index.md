As a Ph.D. student at Virginia Tech, my area of expertise lies in machine learning, data science, and HCI. I hold a master's degree in Artificial Intelligence and Robotics from [Sharif University of Technology](https://en.sharif.edu/), and a bachelor's degree in Engineering Physics from the [University of Tehran](https://ut.ac.ir/en). My research focuses on empathy in human-robot interaction, where I investigate how machines can better understand and respond to human emotions. In my work, I utilize my proficiency in programming languages such as Python, Java, C/C++, and Matlab. Overall, I am passionate about exploring the intersection of technology and human behavior, and using my skills to create more intuitive and empathetic systems.
